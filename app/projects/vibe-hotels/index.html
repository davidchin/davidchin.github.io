      Vibe Hotels needed a website to catalogue their hotels and direct users to their booking engine. I was involved in the production of their desktop and mobile website, from design to implementation.

    SEO requirements

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      One of the challenges was to create a SEO-driven navigation structure. This means pages were in strict silo hierarchy and URLs were packed with rankable keywords. We needed to extend Radiant, a Rails CMS, to create custom Radius tags in order to fulfill some of the SEO requirements.

    Booking engine integration
  </h2>

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      We needed to communicate with their existing booking engine in order to pull the lowest booking rates for each of their hotels. As Radiant internally uses page caching, it had trouble displaying the freshest content without sacrificing performance. To resolve this issue, we had to use Ajax to pull in fresh content.

    Graceful degradation
  </h2>

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      We modularised our SASS code to keep things organised and sharable. Custom jQuery plugins needed to be written in order to render the booking widget, which also needed to degrade gracefully for non-JavaScript users.

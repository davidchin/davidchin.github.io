        BeautyHeaven features news and reviews of the latest beauty products and trends. Also, it has an active forum community. Previously, it only had a desktop website - and I was part of a team responsible for making it mobile-friendly.

        Refactor legacy code
      </h2>

      <p>
        Due to budget constraints, we were not able to convert their legacy desktop website into a responsive website. By heavily extending Twitter Bootstrap framework, and some clever refactoring of the Rails ERB templates, we were able to fulfill the budget requirements.

        Custom blogging tool
      </h2>

      <p>
        The client wanted to extend the CMS so that they could visually tag an image: highlighting what a celebrity is wearing etc... We developed a custom admin tool allowing them to place pins on an image, linking them to related products. We also developed a jQuery plugin encapsulating the logic, so it could be inserted anywhere.

        DoubleClick integration
      </h2>

      <p>
        As the website relies heavily on ads and sponsorship revenue, we needed to make sure that DoubleClick ads were delivered in the correct silos for their desktop and mobile site. Also, we needed to make sure impressions and clicks are correctly tracked and reported.

      BeautyHeaven features news and reviews of the latest beauty products and trends. Previously, it only had a desktop website - and I was part of a team responsible for making it mobile-friendly.

    Refactor legacy code
  </h2>

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      Due to budget constraints, we were not able to convert their legacy desktop website into a responsive website. By heavily extending Twitter Bootstrap framework, and some clever refactoring of the Rails ERB templates, we were able to fulfill the budget requirements.

    Custom blogging tool
  </h2>

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      The client wanted to extend the CMS so that they could visually tag an image: highlighting what a celebrity is wearing etc... We developed a custom admin tool allowing them to place pins on an image, linking them to related products. We also developed a jQuery plugin encapsulating the logic, so it could be inserted anywhere.

    DoubleClick integration

  <div class="project-article-section__body">
    <p>
      As the website relies heavily on ads and sponsorship revenue, we needed to make sure that DoubleClick ads were delivered in the correct silos for their desktop and mobile site.

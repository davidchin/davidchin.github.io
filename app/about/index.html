      Summary
    </h2>

    <p>
      I am a developer, specialising in web and iOS application development. I am experienced in using <em>JavaScript</em> to write dynamic client-side applications interacting with JSON APIs. I worked on many high-traffic projects for well-known brands, and excelled at working as a team to resolve complex technical issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, <em>AngularJS</em> is my preferred client-side MVC framework as it is highly extensible and good at working with dynamic data. When writing CSS and HTML, I prefer using pre-processors such as <em>SASS</em> and <em>HAML</em> respectively due to their cleaner syntax.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also have experience in writing native iOS applications using <em>Swift</em>, that run fast and memory efficient. I have a strong understanding of <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, having worked on various CMS and APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always test my code if I can, using <em>BDD testing</em> frameworks such as Jasmine to help write clean unit and E2E tests. Having worked at an <em>agile development</em> agency for many years, I am familiar with agile principals and continuous integration workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am good at evaluating technical approaches by considering the constraints and goals of a sprint. I am comfortable in engaging code review session with other team members.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy new challenges and learn about the best practices of modern application development.
